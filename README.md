Sophocles' _Ajax_ by the numbers?
------

This project is a first stab at quantifying speaker similarity across multiple dimensions
in Sophocles' _Ajax_.

See [[./experiments.ipynb]] for the latest some experimental data.

This project owes much to the [CLTK](https://cltk.org) and to the data made available
by the Perseus Project at https://github.com/OpenGreekAndLatin/First1KGreek.
